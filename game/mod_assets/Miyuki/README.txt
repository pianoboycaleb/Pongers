Introducing: Miyuki!

To use these sprites, you will need to credit AjTheYandere and Ein Had A Motive.
NSFW/lewd is forbidden, end of discussion.
You can make more expressions/poses/outfits if you'd like but please credit me and Ein for the original sprites.
I guess you can use parts from the sprites, but these are sprite edits in themselves, so it's kinda redundant.
You can change her name.

Other credits: Yagamirai10(some arms), and anita6artania(Body)

Miyuki's Profile: Miyuki is an 18-year-old third-year student. She is quite calm and mellow, but is very protective of her friends. She has a purple belt in martial arts, so she knows how to defend herself. Her poems are usually metaphors for how the world isn't perfect.

Other info:
-Miyuki is MTF (male-to-female) Transgender
-Miyuki is usually calm, the most she shows is annoyance if someone gets on her nerves, if she starts yelling at you, you've messed up.
-If you choose to go to her route, you end up writing journal entries about your day with her, you bring up anime, and the "trap" trope. She voices her opinion on that, disliking it strongly. 
-For the festival preparations, you two would make fliers to advertise the club. You go get papers for the printer and, in typical anime fashion, you trip and fall over her. Near the end, she would come out say she's trans, and how you're the first guy to actually like hanging out with her.
-In Act 2, Monika would tamper with Miyuki's temper, making her more aggressive. Her and Yuri would start to fight over you. Instead of using martial arts, she brings a knife, like Yuri. If you go her route, you still end up talking about anime while writing journal entries. Talking about it angers her, and when she voices her opinion, she does things like bang on the table. After Yuri's death, she would just stare and smile. She was victorious in the end, until Monika deletes her.
